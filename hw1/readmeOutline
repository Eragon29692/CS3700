high level approach:
loop:
- we have a buffer for message
- receive from socketfd go to buffer
- check buffer if it contain the new line
    - no newline -> append buffer to message -> back to loop
    - newline -> append starting from "INFO" of buffer to message (For in case buffer = NULL 0000\nINFO 11111, make sure only append starting from the INFO ... igonore the NULL part)
    	- Reply with the appropriately message
